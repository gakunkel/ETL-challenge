# ETL-challenge
Extracting, Transforming, and Loading data into a database

  This project will entail extraction of cryptocurrency data and news headlines from two APIs. The cryptocurrency data, provided by Coingecko API, will include market volume and exchange rate in relation to several currencies around the world (dating back 30 days). The news headlines will be subjected to NLTK sentiment analysis to analyze trends in price and volume action in relation to media sentiment.
